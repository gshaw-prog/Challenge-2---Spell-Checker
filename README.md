<h1><b>Challenge 2: Spell Checker</b></h1>

This challenge focuses on 
<ul>
<li>B2.5.1 File Processing</li>
<li>B2.1.2 String Manipulation </li>
<li>B2.3.3 Looping Structures</li>
 </ul>


<h2>Problem Description: </h2>
<p>You have two text files: <i>mystery-text.txt</i> (a story generated by an LLM) and <i>ictionary.txt</i>d (a list of valid words, one per line). Your goal is to determine how many words in the mystery-text.txt document are spelled correctly by checking them against the dictionary.txt. Your spell checker should ignore casing and punctuation.</p>

<b>Your Task:</b> Construct a Python program with a function spell_check() that:

<ul>
  <li>Reads the dictionary.txt file and stores all valid words.</li>
  <li>Reads the mystery-text.txt document.</li>
  <li>For each word in the mystery document, normalizes it (removes punctuation, converts to lowercase).</li>
  <li>Checks if the normalized word exists in your stored dictionary.</li>
  <li>Counts the number of correctly spelled words.</li>
</ul>

<b>Input: </b> mystery-text.txt dictionary.txt

<b> Function name: </b> spell_check()

<b> Return Value: </b> An integer, representing the number of correctly spelled words.

<h2>Key Concepts to Apply:</h2>
<ul>
<li>File Processing (B2.5.1): You will read from two separate text files. You will need to efficiently store the dictionary words in memory.</li>
<li>String Manipulation (B2.1.2): This is crucial. You'll need to:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Convert text to lowercase to ignore casing.</li>
    <li>Remove punctuation from words before comparison. You might find methods like replace() or regular expressions useful, though direct character removal loops are also an option.</li>
    <li>Split strings into individual words.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Data Structures (B2.2.2): A list or set is suitable for storing dictionary words. A set is particularly efficient for checking if an item exists (membership testing).</li>
<li>Looping Structures (B2.3.3): Use loops to iterate through the lines and words of both the dictionary and the mystery text.</li>
<li>Debugging Techniques (B2.1.4): Use print statements to display intermediate words or counts, especially during the string manipulation phase, to ensure your words are being processed correctly before checking against the dictionary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints and Guidance:</h2>
<ul>
<li>When reading the dictionary.txt, store all words in a data structure that allows for fast lookups. A Python set is ideal for this.</li>
<li>When processing mystery-text.txt, iterate through the text, extract each word, and then apply your normalization steps (lowercase, remove punctuation).</li>
<li>Consider using Python's str.lower() method and iteratively removing common punctuation marks or using the str.isalpha() method to filter characters.</li>
</ul>
